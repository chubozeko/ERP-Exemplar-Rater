- Update and upload the external ```.csv``` file containing the exemplar data on Amazon MTurk. An example of the format can be found in the ```mturk\exemplar_batch_test.csv``` file.
    - Make sure the _exemplar_url_ property in the ```.csv``` file contains a valid address for a 360 image, otherwise it will display a blank image.
